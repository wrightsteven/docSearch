Python 3.7.3

# Run command
```
python3 docSearch.py
```

# Notes
In ```getNthLetters``` function, ```n``` determines how many letters to skip while searching.
If n=5, the function will take every 5th letter.

```text``` is the source you want to search in.

And ```target``` is the word you want to look for.

To search every 4th letter in the file text.rtf and see if it contains "the", run ```getNthLetters(4, text.rtf, the)```
